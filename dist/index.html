						<h2>Sydnee</h2>
						<p>
							I was born in Great Falls, Montana. Moved around a little bit when
							I was younger to New Mexico and Florida and landed back here in
							Montana when I was going into 4th grade.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I was involved in sports like volleyball, basketball,
							cheerleading, and many other extracurricular activities. I
							graduated high school at Centerville in 2016 and went to college
							for a year as I had gotten a cheerleading scholarship with the
							University of Great Falls (University of Providence).
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I was hoping that as I continued to be in college while
							cheerleading that my dream occupation would expose itself, but
							nothing sounded good to me. I stopped going to college and worked
							at various jobs, from a grocery store, to a dog boarding facility,
							to landscaping, to finally landing in the Great Falls Clinic,
							which is where I have been working for the past year and a half.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I also started selling Scentsy in December of 2020 which has been
							an amazing experience. Some of my hobbies include camping, hiking,
							traveling, and being around any and all dogs.

						<h2>Jake</h2>
						<p>
							I was born in Bozeman, Montana and moved to Great Falls when I was
							about 1 year old. I went to public school until 4th grade and then
							homeschooled from then until I graduated high school. I graduated
							Class of 2014 from Christian Liberty Academy out of Illinois.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I did many programs in 4-H as long as I can remember. Dog,
							archery, and Junior Leader camps were my jam in 4-H. I also helped
							when needed at livestock shows and sales.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							My first job was boarding K9 drug detective dogs for a family
							friend and slowly moved to lawn mowing and plumbing during the
							summer. I landed a sweet job at FedEx Ground in 2014 where I
							worked my way up to manager.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I have been in Montana all my life and proud to call it my home. I
							currently enjoy working on my '78 Chevy truck, camping/hiking,
							backroading, and bonfires with friends.

							<h3>First Met</h3>
							<p>
								We first met at Centerville's Prom in 2014 where we slowly grew
								a friendship, only hanging out when mutual friends invited us
								around to back roading, bonfires, or going to Dairy Queen.
							</p>

							<h3>First Date</h3>
							<p>
								There was a length of time where we stopped communicating and
								stopped crossing paths as much, but sometime in 2015, is when
								our friendship really started to flourish. We started talking
								every day, from the time we would wake up to the time we would
								go to sleep. We slowly started to hang out more one on one,
								meeting in the Walmart parking lot to go on little drives around
								Great Falls or going to get ice cream. Everyone noticed that we
								were getting closer and kept asking when we were going to start
								dating. It was something that we both denied for months. But
								finally, on March 27, 2016, we finally realized that we wanted
								to be more than friends
