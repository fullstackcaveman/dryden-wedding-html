						<h2>Sydnee</h2>
						<p>
							I was born in Great Falls, Montana. Moved around a little bit when
							I was younger to New Mexico and Florida and landed back here in
							Montana when I was going into 4th grade.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I was involved in sports like volleyball, basketball,
							cheerleading, and many other extracurricular activities. I
							graduated high school at Centerville in 2016 and went to college
							for a year as I had gotten a cheerleading scholarship with the
							University of Great Falls (University of Providence).
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I was hoping that as I continued to be in college while
							cheerleading that my dream occupation would expose itself, but
							nothing sounded good to me. I stopped going to college and worked
							at various jobs, from a grocery store, to a dog boarding facility,
							to landscaping, to finally landing in the Great Falls Clinic,
							which is where I have been working for the past year and a half.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I also started selling Scentsy in December of 2020 which has been
							an amazing experience. Some of my hobbies include camping, hiking,
							traveling, and being around any and all dogs.

						<h2>Jake</h2>
						<p>
							I was born in Bozeman, Montana and moved to Great Falls when I was
							about 1 year old. I went to public school until 4th grade and then
							homeschooled from then until I graduated high school. I graduated
							Class of 2014 from Christian Liberty Academy out of Illinois.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I did many programs in 4-H as long as I can remember. Dog,
							archery, and Junior Leader camps were my jam in 4-H. I also helped
							when needed at livestock shows and sales.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							My first job was boarding K9 drug detective dogs for a family
							friend and slowly moved to lawn mowing and plumbing during the
							summer. I landed a sweet job at FedEx Ground in 2014 where I
							worked my way up to manager.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							I have been in Montana all my life and proud to call it my home. I
							currently enjoy working on my '78 Chevy truck, camping/hiking,
							backroading, and bonfires with friends.

							<h3>First Met - March 30, 2014</h3>
							<p>
								We first met at Centerville's Prom in 2014 where we slowly grew
								a friendship, only hanging out when mutual friends invited us
								around to back roading, bonfires, or going to Dairy Queen.

							<h3>First Date - March 2016</h3>
							<p>
								There was a length of time where we stopped communicating and
								stopped crossing paths as much, but sometime in 2015, is when
								our friendship really started to flourish. We started talking
								every day, from the time we would wake up to the time we would
								go to sleep. We slowly started to hang out more one on one,
								meeting in the Walmart parking lot to go on little drives around
								Great Falls or going to get ice cream.
								<br />
								<br />
								Everyone noticed that we were getting closer and kept asking
								when we were going to start dating. It was something that we
								both denied for months. But finally, on March 27, 2016, we
								finally realized that we wanted to be more than friends

							<h3>Proposal - April 4, 2020</h3>
							<p>
								That morning we were hanging out at Jake’s house. He wanted to
								burn some firewood in his fire pit out back. We were sitting
								there alone, and I just looked up at him and said, “You can
								marry me already, you know.” He just smirked and we went on with
								our day.
								<br />
								<br />
								When we left to go to my house, we stopped at the top of Giant
								Springs and looked at the dam. It was windy that day and I did
								not get out of the truck. But Jake went out and looked at the
								overflowing dam and came back to the truck and said “You gotta
								come look at this.” I got out and looked at the dam, and I
								looked at him and he had this different smirk, I didn’t say
								anything. To be honest, I was kinda cranky that day so seeing
								his smirk, I was just like “whatevs.”
								<br />
								<br />
								Nothing happens and when we get to my house, my mom was giving
								him these odd looks because she knew the whole thing was going
								to go down soon. My parents were sitting down for dinner, but
								Jake and I had a late lunch and weren’t hungry. So, we got in my
								65 Chevy and went for a drive around the neighborhood.
								<br />
								<br />
								We went to the gas station to fill up the truck and continued on
								our way. Jake loves to drive the stick shift, so I asked him if
								he wanted to drive us home. He said “sure”, so I pulled over,
								but before I got out, he stopped me and said “Before we switch,
								I gotta ask you something”, I was like “okay?” And he pulled out
								the ring and asked me to marry him!
								<br />
								<br />
								I was SPEECHLESSSSS. I could not pick my jaw up! So in love, and
								in so much awe. So, then we drove back to my parents’ house and
								showed them and then we drove out to his grandparents’ house and
								my grandparents’ house and told them in person.
								<br />
								<br />
								That was something super special to us was being able to tell
								them face to face. So, we told them, came back to town and
								started telling our closest family and friends before we
								announced the next day!
