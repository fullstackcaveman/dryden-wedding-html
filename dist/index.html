						<h2>Sydnee</h2>
						<p>
							I was born in Great Falls, Montana. Moved around a little bit when
							I was younger to New Mexico and Florida and landed back here in
							Montana when I was going into 4th grade. I was involved in sports
							like volleyball, basketball, cheerleading, and many other
							extracurricular activities. I graduated high school at Centerville
							in 2016 and went to college for a year as I had gotten a
							cheerleading scholarship with the University of Great Falls
							(University of Providence). I was hoping that as I continued to be
							in college while cheerleading that my dream occupation would
							expose itself, but nothing sounded good to me. I stopped going to
							college and worked at various jobs, from a grocery store, to a dog
							boarding facility, to landscaping, to finally landing in the Great
							Falls Clinic, which is where I have been working for the past year
							and a half. I also started selling Scentsy in December of 2020
							which has been an amazing experience. Some of my hobbies include
							camping, hiking, traveling, and being around any and all dogs.

						<h2>Jake</h2>
						<p>
							I was born in Bozeman, Montana and moved to Great Falls when I was
							about 1 year old. I went to public school until 4th grade and then
							homeschooled from then until I graduated high school. I graduated
							Class of 2014 from Christian Liberty Academy out of Illinois. I
							did many programs in 4-H as long as I can remember. Dog, archery,
							and Junior Leader camps were my jam in 4-H. I also helped when
							needed at livestock shows and sales. My first job was boarding K9
							drug detective dogs for a family friend and slowly moved to lawn
							mowing and plumbing during the summer. I landed a sweet job at
							FedEx Ground in 2014 where I worked my way up to manager. I have
							been in Montana all my life and proud to call it my home. I
							currently enjoy working on my '78 Chevy truck, camping/hiking,
							backroading, and bonfires with friends.
